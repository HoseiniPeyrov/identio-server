    <!-- Grouping by parentheses as explained above allows coloring of sub-patterns.
        As of version 1.0.5, PatternLayout recognizes "%black", "%red", "%green","%yellow","%blue",
        "%magenta","%cyan", "%white", "%gray", "%boldRed","%boldGreen", "%boldYellow",
        "%boldBlue", "%boldMagenta", "%boldCyan", "%boldWhite" and "%highlight" as
        conversion words. These conversion words are intended to contain a sub-pattern.
        Any sub-pattern enclosed by a coloring word will be output in the specified
        colour. -->
